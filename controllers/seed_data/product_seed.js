      "Everest Base Camp Trek is a classic trip in the Everest region. The trek leads you to the heart of the Khumbu area, where you can feel the Sherpa hospitality and the Tibetan Buddhists culture. \nEBC trek became a popular trip after Tenzing Norgay and Edmund Hillary climbed Mount Everest with a trek through this trail in 1953. It has been turned into the tourist hub for the trekkers and high Himalayan climbers. If you love nature and want to be in the picturesque Himalayan zone, be ready to face the adventure of Everest base camp trekking. \nEBC trek embarks from the tiny airstrip of Lukla after a 35 min fly from Kathmandu. The Himalayan panoramas can be explored from the flight. The features of this trek are awesome landscape, dense alpine woods of rhododendron, birch, juniper and others. \nSome rare wild animals are found in the Sagarmatha National Park. Namche bazaar, Khumjung and Tengbuche are some of the spiritual places, where you can view the ancient Everest monasteries, Chhortens and Sherpa rituals.

    description:
      "Annapurna Base Camp Trek starts from the tourist town- Pokhara. You need to drive about an hour to the starting point. If you are time limited, take a walk through to the Ghandruk village and embark to the ABC. But we recommend the trek via Ghorepani and follow the trail to Chhomrong gradually to ABC. Mostly, the trek goes through the rhododendron forest and the breathtaking views of  the white peaks at the backdrop.The moderate ABC trek is also culturally a significant trek. Basically, Annapurna region is dominated by the ethnic groups as Gurung, Magar, Thakali, Brahmins, Chhetriyas and others. The ethnic groups are forward in the cultural preservation and unique social structure. They are also forward in offering the hospitality. As you pass their communities, you can feel about the hardship of the people in the Himalayan region and also get an opportunity to feel their cultural grandeur.The natural wonders are abundant. The Annapurna base camp is surrounded by the white peaks, so it is also known as the natural amphitheatre. During the trek to ABC, you can explore the panoramas of Fishtail, Annapurna I-IV, Lamjung Himal, Manaslu, Himchuli and dozens of peaks. Of course, the pine and rhododendron forest magnetize you with its perfect youth. If you want to take photographs, this trek is again one of the best trips.",
